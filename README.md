# Always Sprinting
This mod will allow you to smooth go from walking to sprinting as you move the analog stick across its range of motion. I developed this mod to make BONELAB easier to play for players that use locomotion aids such as the Kat Loco S or Kat Walk C. I only have the Kat Loco S, so that is the only hardware that I am able to test with.

Always Sprinting does two things.
1. Disable double tap running
2. Detect when the player's avatar changes and rescale the movement speed.

Double tap sprinting is disabled, because it is unpredictable when using locomotion aids. It's as hard to double tap with your feet as it is to not double tap.

The sprinting speed is walking speed increased by a factor of two, which matches what the game does for the avatars that I looked at. It also feels right and works for the parkour sections that I tested.
